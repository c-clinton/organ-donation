    <p class="columns">Everyone is a potential donor regardless of age, medical condition or sexual orientation. The oldest Canadian organ donor was 92 and the oldest tissue donor was 104. Even individuals with serious illnesses can sometimes be donors. Your decision to register should not be based on whether you think you would be eligible or not. All potential donors are evaluated on an individual, medical, case-by-case basis. </p>

  </div>
  </summary>
    <p class="columns">By registering consent for organ and tissue donation, you give hope to the thousands of Ontarians waiting for a transplant. Individuals on the transplant wait list are suffering from organ failure and without the generous gift of life from an organ donor, they will die. Tissue donors can also enhance the lives of recovering burn victims, help restore sight, and allow people to walk again. Transplants not only save lives, they return recipients to productive lives.</p>

  </summary>
    <p class="columns">Most major religions support organ and tissue donation because it can save the life of another. If your religion restricts the use of a body after death, consult your religious leader: these restrictions may not include organ and tissue donation, if the donation could save another life.

In 2008, Trillium Gift of Life Network adopted an affirmative registry and now your consent to donate organs and tissue is stored in a Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care database. By formally registering, either online at <a href="index.html" class="green">www.BeADonor.ca</a> or in person at any ServiceOntario location, you ensure that your decision is recorded and can be made available to your loved ones at the right time.

    <p class="columns">In order to register consent in Ontario, you must have a valid Ontario health card. This is because the registered consent will be stored in a Ministry of Health and Long Term Care database. Without an Ontario health card, you will not be able to formally register. However, it is important to talk to your family about your wishes. When someone passes away and donation is possible, an Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinator will approach families to talk about donation. By talking to your family about your wishes, you can help relieve the burden of making that choice without confirmation of your wishes. </p>

    <p class="columns">When an Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinator is preparing to speak with a family about donation, they will access the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care database to see if their loved one was a registered donor. That information would be shared with the family and they would be asked to reaffirm that choice. Once consent is given, medical tests are completed to determine what organs and tissues are suitable for transplant. The organs are then matched with someone on the transplant wait list and surgery takes place in an operating room at the hospital. The entire donation process, from the time the family agrees to move forward with donation to recovery, takes about 24 to 36 hours to complete. </p>

When you register your consent to donate, this information is recorded and stored in a Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care database. Your decision will only be accessed should there be potential for donation, and your status as a registered donor will be shared with your family. It is Trillium Gift of Life Network's practice to reaffirm an individual's consent to donate with the family. In most cases, families honour their loved ones' decision to donate if they have evidence that it's what they wanted.</p>

    <h1>The Donation Process</h1>

    <p class="textlarge">In Ontario, organ and tissue donation is coordinated and managed by Trillium Gift of Life Network. Though everyone is a potential donor, you may be surprised to learn that the opportunity for organ donation is rare, because of the need to sustain a patient on a ventilator. In fact, you are five times more likely to need an organ transplant during your lifetime than to have the opportunity to donate one. On average, only three per cent of hospital deaths occur in circumstances that may lead to organ donation. This is not the case for tissue donation, which can take place in most cases when someone has died, as long as the tissue is suitable for transplantation.</p>

    <hr class="small-3">

<p>Because opportunities for organ donation are relatively rare and the impact is life-saving, it's important that Ontarians give serious thought to organ and tissue donation and register their consent to donate. By registering, you are essentially making a decision to help save lives after death through organ and tissue donation. By making this decision, you give hope to patients waiting for a life saving or life enhancing transplant and their families.</p>

<p>Your decision to register is confidential. It is stored in a Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care database and it will only be disclosed to Trillium Gift of Life Network at the appropriate time, once it has been determined that lifesaving efforts have failed. Specially trained staff will then share registration details with your family during end-of-life discussions, to help them make a choice about donation. By registering your consent to donate, you relieve your family of the burden of making this decision on your behalf.</p>

<hr class="small-3">

<p>Once a family has consented to donation, testing is done to confirm the medical suitability of the organs and tissue, and to determine which patients waiting for organ transplantation are the best match for the donated organs. This includes a medical and social history of the donor, similar to the questionnaire completed when donating blood. Trillium Gift of Life Network works closely with a team of healthcare professionals to support grieving families through this process, and to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from the generous gift of organs and/or tissue.</p>

<p>Recovery of organs occurs in the operating room and it is done with skill and respect by physicians. Donation typically does not impact funeral or burial plans, and it often occurs while families are making these arrangements and contacting others. In fact, an open casket funeral is possible. Trillium Gift of Life Network stays in contact with families during this time to inform them when organ and tissue recovery is complete and to share some general information on the recipients.</p>

<p>Through the Donor Family Support program, Trillium Gift of life Network provides continued support, as well as the opportunity to communicate anonymously with recipients. Donor families are recognized and honoured at an annual Celebration of Life, an event held to acknowledge and celebrate the extraordinary gift donor families have given.</p>

    <p>Currently, almost 1,600 people in Ontario are waiting for a life-saving organ transplant.

Some great strides have been made in Ontario over the past year, but still more needs to be done.
